# Soil-Amplification-and-Site-Response-Analysis
The soil profile shows a 50.0 meter thick clay deposit underlain by bedrock. Evaluate
the transfer functions requested below and plot the amplification function with respect to
frequency.
*Evaluate the transfer function and plot the amplification function for surface/rock. Assume
the bedrock is perfectly rigid, constant viscosity ratio (η) for cases η/ηcr = 0 and 0.03.
